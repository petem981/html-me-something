                    <p1> Allow me introduce myself: My name is Mary and I come from a very small town in 
                    a very southern part of the state of Louisiana. I guess one could say I'm Cajun, but 
                    my accent isn't what anyone would expect. How's that? Well, I'm not sure really. But I think 
                    it has something to do with my travels, education and life experiences. </p1>

                    <p4> Military for 10 years that provided me with all sorts of experience. And as I retired, I decided
                    to re-enter the world of all things equine. Because that's where my heart truly lives.</p4>

                    family and to afford my hobby of horsemanship.</p5>
